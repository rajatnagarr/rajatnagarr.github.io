## OpenSAS: Open-Source Spectrum Access System

As part of my research at the Commonwealth Cyber Initiative xG wireless testbed at Virginia Tech, I have been working on OpenSAS, an in-house open-source Spectrum Access System. This project focuses on enabling spectrum-sharing experiments and advancing the capabilities of dynamic spectrum access technologies.

### Project Highlights

* Developed and implemented an open-source Spectrum Access System (SAS) for CBRS band
* Conducted spectrum-sharing experiments to evaluate performance and efficiency
* Integrated AI/ML-based incumbent detection capabilities
* Enabled SAS-SAS communication between multiple OpenSAS instances
* Created a flexible platform for research and experimentation in spectrum sharing

### Impact

This project has contributed to the advancement of spectrum sharing technologies, which are critical for efficient use of limited spectrum resources. The open-source nature of OpenSAS allows other researchers to build upon our work and further advance the field.
