## End-to-End O-RAN Control-Loop for Radio Resource Allocation

This project focused on implementing an end-to-end O-RAN control-loop for radio resource allocation in SDR-based 5G networks. The work demonstrates a practical implementation of O-RAN principles for efficient resource allocation in software-defined radio environments.

### Project Highlights

* Designed and implemented an end-to-end O-RAN control-loop for radio resource allocation
* Utilized software-defined radios to create a flexible 5G network testbed
* Applied O-RAN principles to optimize resource allocation in wireless networks
* Demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach through extensive testing and evaluation
* Received the Best Demo Paper Award at MILCOM 2023

### Impact

This project contributes to the advancement of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) technologies, which are becoming increasingly important in the telecommunications industry. By demonstrating a practical implementation of O-RAN principles for resource allocation, this work helps bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world applications.
