This paper discusses the implementation and evaluation of AI/ML-based incumbent detection in a Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) experimental network through OpenSAS. The research demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be integrated into spectrum access systems to improve detection capabilities.
