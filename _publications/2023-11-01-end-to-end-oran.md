This paper presents an end-to-end O-RAN control-loop for radio resource allocation in SDR-based 5G networks. The research demonstrates a practical implementation of O-RAN principles for efficient resource allocation in software-defined radio environments. This paper received the Best Demo Paper Award at MILCOM 2023.
