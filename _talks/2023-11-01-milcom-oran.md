Presented research on implementing an end-to-end O-RAN control-loop for radio resource allocation in SDR-based 5G networks at the IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM) 2023. This presentation received the Best Demo Paper Award.

## Abstract

This presentation demonstrated a practical implementation of O-RAN principles for efficient resource allocation in software-defined radio environments. The work showcased how O-RAN architectures can be leveraged to optimize radio resource allocation in 5G networks, with potential applications in military communications.

## Key Points

* Overview of O-RAN architecture and its benefits for military communications
* Implementation details of the control-loop for radio resource allocation
* Demonstration of the system using software-defined radios
* Performance evaluation and comparison with traditional approaches
* Discussion of challenges and future research directions

## Impact

The research presented contributes to the advancement of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) technologies, which are becoming increasingly important in both commercial and military telecommunications. By demonstrating a practical implementation of O-RAN principles for resource allocation, this work helps bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world applications.
