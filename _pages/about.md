## Professional Summary

I am a PhD student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech, focusing on wireless communications, 5G technology, and software-defined radios. My research interests include spectrum-sharing, CBRS testbed design, and O-RAN-compatible open-source 5G NR cellular stacks.

Currently, I work as a Graduate Research Assistant at the Commonwealth Cyber Initiative xG wireless testbed at Virginia Tech Arlington Research Center, where I conduct spectrum-sharing experiments with OpenSAS, an in-house open-source Spectrum Access System.
