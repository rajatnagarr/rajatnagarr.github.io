# Profile Image

To add your profile image to the website:

1. Replace the `profile.png` file in this directory with your own profile image.
2. Make sure the image is square (1:1 aspect ratio) for best results.
3. A recommended size is 500x500 pixels.
4. The image should be in PNG or JPG format.

## Placeholder Images

This directory should also contain placeholder images for your portfolio items:

- `opensas.png`: Placeholder for the OpenSAS project
- `oran-control.png`: Placeholder for the O-RAN Control-Loop project
- `rf-energy.png`: Placeholder for the RF Energy Harvesting project

You can replace these with actual images related to your projects.
